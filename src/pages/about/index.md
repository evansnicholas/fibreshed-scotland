title: What is Fibreshed Scotland?
---
Fibreshed Scotland / Scotland Fibreshed is a growing community of producers, makers, consumers, 
and educators who work with and promote locally produced wool, linen, leather and natural dyes products.

We aim to develop a Scotland-wide, regenerative fibre community by increasing connectivity between 
farmers and artisans, exploring feasibility of bringing back mid scale processing, and 
promoting skill sharing to ensure the natural and cultural heritage of Scottish textiles 
continues in an environmentally responsible and ethical way.
