This week brought us to the end of this cycle of Conversations with some really beautiful insights shared.  The idea of focussing on our Gifts is that that is the strongest basis for moving forwards into the community we seek to create:  If you label me as ‘remote’, ‘inefficient’ or ‘disabled’, that’s what you get: and hence _what do you want my deficiencies or my capacities?_

We noted that in the UK, many of us approach the idea of talking about our gifts with some ambivalence or even discomfort.  Some of us were brought up to think ‘blowing your own trumpet’ is boastful and to be discouraged. And a lot of gifts come with their shadow side - an inspiring self-confidence might become arrogance, and a quick way with words could fill the space when others might like to talk or to pause for a moment or two. 

The questions were designed to bring into the lime-light some of the gifts we don’t fully acknowledge - by asking about feedback that continues to surprise us, and gifts that we don’t fully acknowledge. Here are some things I heard: 



* The gifts that come from fully listening
* Knowing that time spent taking out ‘wrong’ stitches in a garment can be a way forwards into feeling better in oneself
* Knowing the value of really slowing down
* That I’m a patient teacher
* The importance of reaching out to ensure that voices are heard, especially in contexts where structures tend to marginalise and exclude

We also found that some of the Gift questions didn’t really work for all of us.  Perhaps they are best targeted at busy folk who don’t always find the time to slow up and reflect.  Things are not always what they seem and we should be wary of making assumptions. 

During and since our final conversation, I’ve been delighted by feedback from people who reported feeling sceptical of the point of such conversations at the start of but by the end were talking about their value.  And in contrast, the observation that when artists and creators are planning to collaborate, for example on an exhibition, they invest a great deal of time in getting to know each other so that they can have confidence that such a collaboration will be fruitful.  So, maybe, providing space for slowing up and reflection is needed more by some of us than others - please see[ here](/blog/2023-12-06-six-conversations-reflections/) for some overarching reflections on the Conversations we’ve had, and the opportunities we have for moving forwards together. 

In closing, I’d like to express my deep appreciation to all who have been part of the Conversations.  I’ve certainly learned and been challenged by the things I’ve heard and believe Fibreshed Scotland is in a better place from which to move forwards.  

We are hoping to build on the momentum and interest we’ve created by meeting to discuss ‘Next Steps’ on **Thursday 7th December 11.30-1.30.** We’re intending to shape up what we do and how we do it, hence our agenda will cover:


* Our material focus (wool/linen/hemp etc - through all the stages from farm to production and markets and ultimately back to soil)
* Linking up with Fibreshed International
* Regionality within Scotland
* How we organise ourselves (our core team, communications, meet-ups and so on) 

Please let us know at <span style="text-decoration:underline;">fibreshedscotland@gmail.com</span> if you’d like to come along and we’ll send you the link.
