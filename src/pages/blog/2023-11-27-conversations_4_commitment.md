We had two lovely conversations this week.  The commitment conversation focussed on letting go of preconceptions, and thinking more broadly about what as individuals we’d really like to contribute, as well as how engagement in Fibreshed could connect to our own enterprises and initiatives. 

Several people commented on the value of the questions for taking us a bit deeper into _how we want to be_ together, as well as _what we want to do_. Someone described seeing ourselves as a family as we go deeper into these conversations, and that the Fibreshed concept points to a way forward for ourselves as individuals, for our communities and for the kind of economy we want to participate in.  

By the end, most people felt comfortable to make a commitment to Fibreshed Scotland.  We put emphasis on any commitment being freely given and meaningful as opposed to just lip service, or following some group think. 

Here’s some examples of what people said: 

**Specific practical things out there in the world:**

* Committing to getting some sheep fleeces into the hands of makers and not into the fire pit!
* Building towards a Flax Festival next September
* To collaborate and assist with a set up of a textile seed library in Scotland;  Be a vessel for flax seeds grown in Glasgow and facilitate exchange from Glaswegian small scale growers to flax gardens to the rest of Scotland and maybe beyond?

**Support to the keeping our wheels turning:**

* To continue to engage and be present at the meetings
* To share what I know
* A commitment to having an interest in Fibreshed Scotland and doing what I can to support it as it progresses and grows.
* I promise to consider how we might document the growth of Fibreshed Scotland
* Time (to organise, to write funding applications, to make) and resources through Fantasy Fibre Mill (where available).
* I promise to do the best I can to promote and support Fibreshed Scotland in any way needed, in the background with admin and awareness raising …

**Keeping our hearts and minds open to what we are and could be:**

* I promise to continue listening and discussing a collective way forwards 
* I promise to continue to offer space to help bring people interested in Fibreshed Scotland together to create the community we want to be, and to learning what works best for us
* … but most of all I promise to hold an open space in my heart to all that also wish to be on this journey. 

It felt like that promise is a real gift to us all, and takes us neatly on to the final Conversation of this cycle which is about the gifts we bring to the world. **The Conversations will be on Wednesday 29th (7pm) and Thursday 30th (1pm)**.  You’re very welcome to join, whether or not you’ve been along before or missed a session or two along the way. 

** and a **SAVE THE DATE**  for **Thursday 7th December 11.30am -1.30pm  **- this will be a **‘NEXT STEPS’** meeting from these conversations - wrapping up what we’ve talked about and unfolding some practical actions from what we’ve been discussing. More details to follow by email.
